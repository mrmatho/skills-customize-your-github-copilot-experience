# 📘 Assignment: Python Text Processing

## 🎯 Objective

Master string manipulation, file input/output operations, and text processing techniques in Python. You'll learn how to read files, parse text data, transform strings, and write results back to files—essential skills for working with real-world data.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Text File Analysis and Transformation

#### Description
Create a Python program that reads a text file, performs various text processing operations, and outputs the results. Your program should analyze text content, manipulate strings, and demonstrate proficiency with file I/O operations.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Read text from an input file
- Perform string operations such as converting case, counting occurrences, or searching for patterns
- Filter, clean, or transform the text data (e.g., remove whitespace, split into words, find specific phrases)
- Write the processed results to an output file
- Handle file operations properly (opening, reading, closing files)
- Include clear output formatting and descriptive messages

### 🛠️ Word Frequency Counter

#### Description
Extend your text processing skills by building a program that analyzes word frequency in a text file. This task reinforces string manipulation, data structures, and file I/O.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Read a text file and extract all words
- Count the frequency of each word (case-insensitive)
- Sort words by frequency (highest to lowest)
- Write a report showing the top words and their counts
- Handle punctuation appropriately (strip from words or remove entirely)
- Display statistics such as total words and unique word count
